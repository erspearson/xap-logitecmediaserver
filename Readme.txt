To install, copy the 'xAP' folder in this zip file to the 'Plugins' directory in your SqueezeCenter installation.
On Windows this is normally 'C:\Program Files\SqueezeCenter\server\Plugins'.
If you have an earlier version already installed then delete its folder before installing the update.
Then re-start SqueezeCenter.
The xAP plugin is turned on by default; heartbeat messages will be generated soon after startup.
The plugin settings can be found on the web interface at settings/advanced/xAP Home Automation.
